**Competitive Programming Repository**

Here, I will upload some competitive programming problems I attempt (mainly in Java). These problems will be from a variety of sources, such as Codeforces and USACO.

NOTE: If you are using my repo so that you can just copy and paste my solutions to get the right answers - don't. Try to get the answer on your own first, but feel free to use my repo as a reference or a guide.

Also NOTE: Most files I upload into my repo are accepted/correct solutions. If not, I will make a note of that as a comment in the file.
